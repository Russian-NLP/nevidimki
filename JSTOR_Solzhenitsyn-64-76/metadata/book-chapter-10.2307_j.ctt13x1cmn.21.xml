         <p>The contributors to this volume address themselves to the growth, behavior, and prospects of the two largest Communist parties in Western Europe. The book deals in particular with the adaptation of the French and Italian Communist parties to the secular changes in their advanced societies. It emphasizes the different attempts made by each party's leaders to participate actively and fruitfully in parliamentary political systems.</p>

                     <p>This volume was conceived during a conference held several years ago at Arden House under the auspices of the Planning Group on Comparative Communist Studies. The conference had been called to test the proposition that a group of specialists on the world’s nonruling Communist parties could design a framework for research on this group of parties, as had been earlier attempted, with some success, for the Communist parties in power.¹ In terms of that goal, the Arden House conference was a failure—stimulating and thoroughly enjoyable, but a failure. By and large the participants went home prepared to agree that</p>

                     <p>This volume approaches in different ways the evolution and adaptation of the French and Italian Communist parties. Many of the essays report the results of recent empirical research on party organizations and cadres operating in a variety of geographical and institutional settings. Others, including this one, approach the problem from the broader perspective of how the parties as a whole have acted—that is to say, how their leaders have responded to the infinite variety of signals that reach them from the party organization, from the domestic political arena, from the economic and labor fronts, from the international scene.

                     <p>For a long time many sincere people believed—and many still believe—that the French Communist party constitutes a serious threat to the French political system. This fear, alive since at least 1928, has often come to a head: in 1936 after the electoral triumph of the Popular Front and the wave of strikes and factory occupations that followed; in June 1940 when General Weygand announced to one of the last Councils of Ministers of the Third Republic: “Thorez is installed in the Elysée Palace . . .”; in 1944-1945 when the Parti Communiste Frangais (PCF) seemed to hold all</p>

                     <p>When the reigning orthodoxy among students of comparative communism began to give way, after 1956, to the admission that the Communist world could be less than monolithic, it was inevitable that, sooner or later, students of nonruling Communist parties would begin to ask: “How do Communist activists in Western parliamentary systems mediate between their primary roles as party loyalists and their roles in the political system as a whole?” At the local level, the problem could be approached through an analysis of a Communist party’s policies: Did such policies aim to advance the interests of the working class or, rather,</p>

                     <p>Students of European radicalism in this century have been mesmerized by two events that bracketed the First World War: the decision of the German Social Democrats in 1914 to vote credits to finance the Kaiser’s war, thus formalizing the domestication of Marxism that had been occurring in Western Europe during the previous several decades; and the seizure of power by Lenin's Bolsheviks in 1917, consummating a violent revolution led by a sectarian, “vanguard” party. Throughout the subsequent decades our interpretations of radical politicians have oscillated between the two poles symbolized by these events. Activists and leaders claiming to want revolutionary</p>

                     <p>A generally successful adaptability that is marred by serious regional failures has been the hallmark of the Partito Comunista Italiano (PCI) throughout the postwar period. The strategy of the PCI, perhaps more strikingly than for any other nonruling Communist party, requires it to adapt to its social environment, and often leads observers to mistakenly label it revisionist. Such an evaluation is inappropriate, for where its political strategies have been successful, the PCI has stimulated desired changes in the environment in which it operated. Successful adaptation is not passive capitulation, but complex manipulation of social forces. Yet an inept attempt to</p>

                     <p>The strategy of most political parties is shaped in part by a determination to share or control national political power, and formulations of strategy are made in terms of the national political, economic, and social context. What alliances should a party seek? What activities and policies should it pursue? How should the party organization function? The answers to all these questions will be based on the party leadership’s understanding of what is necessary in order to shift, or maintain, the national balance of power in the party’s favor. In many cases, however, implementation of the strategy depends heavily on lower</p>

                     <p>Scholars have often treated French political parties as homogeneous entities. Relying on official declarations and writings of national party leaders, they tend to overemphasize the decision-making process at the top and to assume that what happens in Paris adequately represents party life throughout France. The Parti Communiste Frangais (PCF) has been studied in this way for two fairly good reasons: until recently access to party archives has been difficult if not impossible; furthermore, the principle of democratic centralism seemed to preclude differences between branches of the party. Such an approach is misleading in that it underestimates the influence of regional</p>

                     <p>Far from being the instruments of liberation for the proletariat, legislative and other [municipal] assemblies serve to guarantee the continuation of capitalist domination and, in addition to the social conservatism [which they represent], they hypocritically permit the masses to participate in the manufacture of the rods with which they are to be beaten. . . .

                     <p>Many discussions of party strategies focus quite properly on elites at both the national and local level. In the generation, application, and evaluation of strategies and tactics, party elites play a crucial role. But focusing exclusively on the elite of a party is unsatisfactory because implementing strategy involves other factors. Moreover, when the strategy involves mobilizing broad social groups, the relevant factors multiply rapidly. Leaders and activists of one party must not only consider the probable response by comparable leaders of other parties, but also determine at what segments of the population to aim. To assess whether, and to what</p>

The PCF’s strength within the CGT has not been challenged since 1947. And, by virtue of its predominance in size and legitimacy over other unions, the CGT has been the determinant actor in French union life since.¹ At present, even after the ravages of the Cold War, CGT membership represents 65 percent of all organized workers in France, and the CGT regularly wins 60-65 percent of votes in professional elections</p>

In both France and Italy, the Communist party has, for some time, maintained an uneasy position between opposition and compromise, a position to which the models of “revisionism” and “integration,” derived from the earlier European social-democratic experience, do not really apply. Nor can these parties be effectively understood as variants of the “party of total opposition,” a model popular during the Cold War, for they participate in numerous ways in the day-to-day life of Parliaments, local</p>
