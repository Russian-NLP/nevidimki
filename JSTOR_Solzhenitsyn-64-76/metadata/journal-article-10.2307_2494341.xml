"History lives and grows like a tree. For history, reason is an axe. You can't
cultivate it with reason. Or, if you like, history is a river. It has its own laws governing
its currents, its bends, its eddies. But these smart alecks come along and say it's a
stagnant pond and that it must be redirected into another channel, a better one. All we
have to do is choose the right place to dig the trench. But the flow of the stream can't
be broken off. If you move it just one inch the stream no longer exists. And they tell
us to uproot it and move it a mile. The flow of generations, institutions, traditions,
customs, is the flow of the stream" (p. 377)</mixed-citation>

nation a thousand years old would perish. There had already been two defeats in succes-
